<h1>Week 2: Hands-on Exercise</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p><strong>Prerequisite: </strong>Finish Linux install first if you didn't finish it from the prepare material.</p>
<p><strong>Task: </strong>Create a list of current processes running on your Linux OS.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose: </strong>This activity will allow you to recognize the resources required to make an operating system function and show it on Linux.</p>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

  <h3>Part 1: Open the Task Manager equivalent on your Linux VM (in Virtual Box or UTM)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Open the Linux equivalent (ex: System Monitor) of the task manager (Windows/PC), activity monitor (Mac/Apple), or whichever similar interface the operating system on your computer uses to display current processes and resource utilization but in Linux.
    <p>This may require some individual searching and research if you do not know how to do this on your Linux operating system.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
      <h3>Part 2: Take screenshots of processes, RAM, and free space in Linux using the GUI (not terminal/shell)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Within the Linux System Monitor, take three screenshots:
    <ul>
      <li>Your screenshot also needs to show the date and time. List of current processes running. This is from whatever Linux OS you are running in Virtual Box or UTM.</li>
      <li>How much RAM is currently being used on Linux.</li>
      <li>The current free space and the total capacity of your Linux hard drive.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul> 
<h3>Part 3: Show the same information in the Linux terminal/shell</h3> 
<ul>
  <li> Your screenshot also needs to show the date and time. 
    In the terminal, bring up the information for current processes, RAM being used, and hard drive capacity and free space. Take a screenshot to show these three pieces of information.
    <ul><li>If you do not know the commands to do this, use AI to help you learn.</li></ul>
  </li>
</ul> 

<h3>Part 4: Submission</h3>
<p>Submit your several screenshots in one document. Include your name and the date.</p>

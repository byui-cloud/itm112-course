<h1>Week 3: Hands-on Exercise</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p><strong>Prerequisite: </strong>Finish W03 Prepare: Most Used Applications if you didn't finish it from the prepare material.</p>
<p><strong>Task: </strong>Complete the exercise and take screenshots of your work.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose: </strong>Demonstrate your knowledge of third-party open-source apps in a Linux environment and install five.</p>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

  <h3>Part 1: Prepare to download and install the open-source applications</h3> 
    <ul>
      <li>
        Ensure you have the file downloads for the Linux-friendly applications you identified in the Prepare activity.
      </li>
      <li>
        We will be installing those apps on your Linux VM and seeing how they compare to the commercial apps you have used.
      </li>
    </ul>
  <h3>Part 2: Open and login to the Local Ubuntu Linux (Virtual Box or UTM)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Open your Local Ubuntu Linux OS in Virtual Box or UTM and login with your username and password.
      </li>
      <li>
        Do not use AWS. If your hard drive runs out of space, expand the hard drive and restart the VM (Virtual Machine) OS.
      </li>
    </ul>
  <h3>Part 3: Find and open the 'Ubuntu Software' manager, the orange suitcase on the sidebar of Linux</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>If you don't see the orange suitcase to install applications, look in the menu in the bottom left corner. If you still don't see it, you may need to install it by opening a terminal window and run these commands:
        <ul>
        <li>sudo apt update</li>
        <li>sudo apt install snapd</li>
        <li>sudo snap install snap-store</li>
        </ul>
      <li>Once the install finishes, click on the nine white boxes in the bottom left corner and search for 'snap' and open it.</li>   
    </ul>

<h3>Part 4: In the Ubuntu Software manager, search for and install the five apps on your Linux VM</h3> 
<ul>
  <li>Within the Ubuntu Software, find your top five applications you researched in the prepare assignment and install them.</li>
  <li>If you have trouble finding or installing any of the applications, use AI to help you learn.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Part 5: Play with the Linux-friendly apps to compare them to the five apps you use most</h3> 
<ul>
  <li>Play around with the alternative apps enough that you have a basic idea of how they compare to the apps you use in your preferred operating system.</li>
  <li>Open all five applications and take a screenshot (including the date and time) of them all running on your Linux VM. Type your name somewhere in one of the apps or in the terminal.</li>
</ul> 

<h3>Part 6: Submission</h3>
<p>Submit your screenshots in one document. Include your name, the date, and time.</p>

    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
      <li><strong>Task: </strong>Complete the exercises and take screenshots of your work.</li>
      <li><strong>Purpose: </strong>Demonstrate your knowledge of variables in a Linux environment.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
      <li><strong>Read: </strong>the Hands-on Exercise Scenario provided.</li>
      <li><strong>Complete: </strong>each part of the exercise in your Linux system (AWS or local VM).</li>
      <li><strong>Submit: </strong>your completed deliverables for each part of the assignment by the due date.</li>
    </ul>    

    <h2>Exercise</h2>
      <h3>Part 1: Creating a variable and exporting it</h3>
        <p><strong>Ask your favorite AI:</strong>"What if your supervisor wants you to create a variable (use your name) that is exported in another shell or a child process? Create the variable and export it. Open a sub-shell process and see if the variable is there before and after the export."</p>
        <p>ls ..........</p>
      <h4>Next Steps</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Open your Ubuntu Linux (either AWS or local VM).</li>
        <li>Complete the scenario and ask AI for help as needed.</li>
        <li>Make sure your name is in the variable for identity confirmation.</li>
        <li>Take a screenshot of your work.</li>
      </ul>  

      <h3>Part 2: Make a persistent variable</h3>
      <p><strong>Ask your favorite AI:</strong>"How can I make a saved/persistent variable that will still work after a reboot in Linux? Give me an example I can do in the terminal/shell using my name."</p>
      <h4>Next Steps</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>In your Ubuntu Linux (either AWS or local VM).</li>
          <li>Complete the scenario and ask AI for help as needed.</li>
          <li>Make sure your name is in the variable for identity confirmation.</li>
          <li>Take a screenshot of your work.</li>
        </ul>        
      <h3>Part 3: Create a short cut to a class folder</h3>
      <p><strong>Ask your favorite AI:</strong>"How can I set a short cut to a class class folder in Linux? Help me do it in the terminal/shell."</p>
      <h4>Next Steps</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>In your Ubuntu Linux (either AWS or local VM).</li>
          <li>Complete the scenario and ask AI for help as needed.</li>
          <li>Type your name in the terminal for identity confirmation.</li>
          <li>Take a screenshot of your work.</li>
        </ul>  
      <h3>Part 4: Alias</h3>
      <p><strong>Ask your favorite AI to: </strong>Now make your own alias for a command and run it. Use your name for the alias.</p>
      <p>Make sure to put your real name for the alias that you type for the scenario in your terminal/shell.</p>
      <h4>Next Steps</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>In your Ubuntu Linux (either AWS or local VM).</li>
          <li>Complete the scenario and ask AI for help as needed.</li>
          <li>Type your name as the alias for identity confirmation.</li>
          <li>Take a screenshot of your work.</li>
        </ul>  
      <h3>Part 5: Save a variable for your public IP address</h3>
      <p><strong>Ask your favorite AI to: </strong>Set a variable that is saved in your bashrc file and have it be called yournameip and save your public IP address. Your Linux server/system may not know its public ip so this could be useful in some situations. Use 'echo' to view your IP address.</p>
      <p>Make sure to put your real name for the variable that you type for the scenario in your terminal/shell.</p>
      <h4>Next Steps</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>In your Ubuntu Linux (either AWS or local VM).</li>
          <li>Complete the scenario and ask AI for help as needed.</li>
          <li>Type your name as the variable for identity confirmation.</li>
          <li>Use the 'echo' command with your variable to see your public IP address. Ask AI if you need help.</li>
          <li>Take a screenshot of your work.</li>
        </ul> 
  <h2>Submission</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Submit one document with your screenshots from the excercise scenarios above that have your name and the date/time in pictures.</li>

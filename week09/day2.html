    <h2>Google Cloud Platform (GCP) & Docker</h2>
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
      <li><strong>Task: </strong>Complete the exercises in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and take screenshots of your work.</li>
      <li><strong>Purpose: </strong>Demonstrate your knowledge of GCP and other docker commands in a Linux environment.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
      <li><strong>Read: </strong>the Hands-on Exercise Scenarios and ask your favorite AI for help as needed.</li>
      <li><strong>Complete: </strong>each part of the exercise in Google's Cloud Linux system.</li>
      <li><strong>Submit: </strong>your completed deliverables for each part of the assignment by the due date.</li>
    </ul>    

    <h2>Exercise</h2>
      <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>Connect to the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) cloud shell at https://console.cloud.google.com/.  Login with your @byui.edu email or your own gmail if you are not already logged in. Click on the Activate Cloud Shell button (it should be in the top right menu).</p>
      <h3>Part 1: Find What is Already Installed in GCP</h3>
        <p><strong>Pick a few of these and run some commands: </strong>in the Google Cloud Shell to find out what versions of these are running: Java, Go, Python, Node, NPM, PHP, Ruby, .NET, Git, Docker, etc.</p>
        <p>Try a command like "java --help" and then look at the output to find out how to see the version number. Type the command to output the version number of a few of these.</p>
        <p>Try a few more.</p>
        
      <h4>Next Steps</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Make sure to open the GCP terminal/shell for a Linux prompt.</li>
        <li>Complete the exercises and ask AI for help as needed.</li>
        <li>Make sure your name is in the scenario or terminal for identity confirmation.</li>
        <li>Take a screenshot of your work with the date and time.</li>
      </ul>  

      <h3>Part 2: Deploy C++ API Docker Container</h3>
      <p><strong>Choose a docker sample you want to try: </strong><a href="https://github.com/dockersamples">https://github.com/dockersamples</a> From the GCP terminal, launch a sample docker.  Here is an example: <a href="https://github.com/dockersamples/c-plus-plus-docker">https://github.com/dockersamples/c-plus-plus-docker</a></p>
      <p>Example commands if you choose the C++ API docker:</p>
      <code>git clone https://github.com/dockersamples/c-plus-plus-docker</code><br>
      <code>cd c-plus-plus-docker/</code><br>
      <code>vi ok_api.cpp</code><br>
      <p>Inside the vi text editor, change 'ok' to 'ok yourname':</p>
      <ul>
        <li>#Now you are using VIM or VI text editor. To edit the file:</li>
        <li>Type "i" to go into insert mode, which allows you to add text:</li>
        <code>Press the 'i' key to enter insert mode.</code>
        <p>Press the arrow keys on your keboard to move to 'ok'</p>
        <p>Type yourname next to 'ok' (put your actual name: ex: Bob Jones)</p>
        <p>To exit "insert" mode in VIM, hit ESC on your keyboard.</p>
        <p>Type ":wq". That will save (write) and quit.</p>
        <li>If you have problems and need to save without quitting, type: ESC and then ":q!".</li>        
      </ul>
      <p>Build the C++ docker container/image:</p>
      <code>docker compose up --build</code><br>
      <p>When you see this message: "Listening on: http://0.0.0.0:8080/" it is running</p>
      <p>Click on the "Web Preview" button (above the terminal) and click "Preview on Port 8080" and now you just accessed the API</p>
      <p>It should open a new tab in your browser and show: "message: OK yourname"</p>
      <h4>Next Steps</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>In GCP, complete the scenario and ask AI for help as needed.</li>
          <li>Make sure your name is in the scenario or terminal for identity confirmation.</li>
          <li>Take a screenshot of your work with the date and time.</li>
        </ul>        
      <h3>Part 3: Extra Mile</h3>
      <p><strong>Find: </strong>the Linux version the docker container is running. To do this, run "docker exec -it c-plus-plus-docker-ok-api-1 bash". Once you get the new shell, type 'cat /etc/os-release'. To get out of the bash shell inside your container, type "exit".</p>
      <p>Install and run another docker sample.</p>
 
  <h2>Submission</h2>
  <p>Submit one document with your screenshots from the excercise scenarios above that have your name and the date/time in pictures.</p>

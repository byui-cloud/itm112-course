    <h2>Exercise</h2>
      <h3>Part 1: Hacked Cron Jobs</h3>
        <p><strong>Ask your favorite AI: </strong>"Something might have been hacked on my Linux system. Help me look at automated cron jobs in my Linux terminal to see if they escalated privileges through it. Help me look at user cron jobs."</p>
      <h4>Next Steps</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Open your Ubuntu Linux (either AWS or local VM).</li>
        <li>Complete the scenario and ask AI for help as needed.</li>
        <li>Make sure your name is in the scenario or terminal for identity confirmation.</li>
        <li>Take a screenshot of your work with the date and time.</li>
      </ul>    

      <h3>Part 2: Root Cron Jobs</h3>
      <p><strong>Ask your favorite AI: </strong>"You need to see if the root user has a cronjob that the hacker used."</p>
      <h4>Next Steps</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>In your Ubuntu Linux (either AWS or local VM).</li>
          <li>Complete the scenario and ask AI for help as needed.</li>
          <li>Make sure your name is in the scenario or terminal for identity confirmation.</li>
          <li>Take a screenshot of your work with the date and time.</li>
        </ul>  

      <h3>Part 3: Create Cron Job Running Every Minute</h3>
      <p><strong>Ask your favorite AI: </strong>"Create a cron job that runs every minute that has your name in it and says something like, "Hello yourname". Check to see if it is running. Ask AI if you need help. Turn in screenshots of your cron job working."</p>
      <h4>Next Steps</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>In your Ubuntu Linux (either AWS or local VM).</li>
          <li>Complete the scenario and ask AI for help as needed.</li>
          <li>Make sure your name is in the scenario or terminal for identity confirmation.</li>
          <li>Take a screenshot of your work with the date and time.</li>
        </ul>  

      <h3>Part 4: Create AWS SMB File Server and Connect</h3>
      <p><strong>Complete 4 Part Tutorial: </strong><a href="https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-and-configure-samba#1-overview">Ubuntu Samba Share</a></p>
      <h4>Next Steps</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>In your AWS Ubuntu Linux (AWS required).</li>
          <li>Complete the scenario and ask AI for help as needed.</li>
          <li>Make sure your name is in the scenario or terminal for identity confirmation.</li>
          <li>Take a screenshot of your work with the date and time.</li>
        </ul> 
      <h4>Finishing Up</h4> 
        <ul>
          <li>Make sure to click the next arrow on each page of the tutorial to see all four parts.</li>
          <li>Set up Windows file sharing in your AWS/Cloud Ubuntu instance. You must modify the security group to allow inbound Server Message Block (SMB) traffic to your Ubuntu AWS Linux.</li>
          <li>Open the Security Group. Ask AI if you don't know what port to open.</li>
          <li>Connect to the Samba share from your local Windows or Mac/Apple computer. Ask AI if you need help.</li>
          <li>Use your IPv4 instance's IP address to connect.</li>
          <li>Once you connect, create a text file on the SMB server named {your firstname_lastname}.txt. For the file's content, enter Hello from {your name} and save the changes to the file and add a sentence of your own. Second, download a BYUI logo image and drag and drop it to the Windows file share location.  </li>
          <li>Submit a screenshot of your file using a cat command from your Cloud Ubuntu instance showing the files in the /home/{username}/sambashare directory you created.</li>

        </ul>

  <h2>Submission</h2>
    <p>Submit your screenshots in one document showing the scenarios above. Include your name and the date.</p>  

  <h2>Extra Mile</h2>
    <p>Help your neighbor. Then additionally, connect to a classmate's samba share and create a text file named {your firstname_lastname}.txt. This file would be on your classmate's samba share. You can create it locally and upload it or try creating it directly on the share.</p>
    <p>Complete some or all of the tutorial.</p>
